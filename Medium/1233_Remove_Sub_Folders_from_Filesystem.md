# Problem: 1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem

#### Approach:
The original solution missed certain edge cases where similar folder paths could appear but were not sub-folders (e.g., `"/a/b/c"` and `"/a/b/ca"`). To address this, we need a solution that correctly identifies only direct sub-folder relationships.

### Corrected Approach

1. **Sort the Folders Lexicographically:** Sorting helps us keep related folders next to each other.
2. **Filter Using Prefix Matching:** As we iterate over the sorted list, check if the current folder is a sub-folder of the previous valid folder:
   - This is done by confirming if the current folder starts with the previous folder plus a `'/'`.
3. **Add Non-Sub-Folders to the Result List:** Only add folders to the result if they do not match the prefix criteria of being a sub-folder of the last added folder.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting: **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of folders.
- Iteration and prefix check: **O(n)**.
- Overall complexity: **O(n log n)**.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** for storing the final list of folders.

### Code Implementation

#### Python Code:
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeSubfolders(self, folder: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Sort folders lexicographically to ensure sub-folders follow their parents
        folder.sort()
        result = []
        
        for f in folder:
            # Only add to result if itâ€™s not a sub-folder of the last added folder
            if not result or not f.startswith(result[-1] + '/'):
                result.append(f)
                
        return result
```

### Explanation:

- **Sorting the folders** makes it so that parent folders appear before their sub-folders.
- **Checking for Sub-Folder Condition:** Each folder is added to `result` only if it does not begin with the last added folder in `result` followed by `'/'`.
- **Efficient Filtering**: This ensures that we only store folders that are not sub-folders of any others.

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1:
```python
Input: folder = ["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]
Output: ["/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]
```

#### Test Case 2:
```python
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"]
```

#### Test Case 3:
```python
Input: folder = ["/a", "/a/b", "/a/b/c", "/a/b/d", "/e", "/e/f"]
Output: ["/a", "/e"]
```

### Edge Cases:
- The input contains only one folder.
- All folders are nested within a single root folder.
- There are no sub-folders, and all folders are independent.
