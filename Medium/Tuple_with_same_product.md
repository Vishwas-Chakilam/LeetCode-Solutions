# 🧮 Tuple with Same Product (LeetCode 1726)

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given an array of distinct positive integers `nums`, return the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that:

\[
a \times b = c \times d
\]

where `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are distinct pairs.

Each valid tuple contributes **8 permutations** to the final count.

### **Example 1**
```python
Input: nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]
Output: 8
```

### **Example 2**
```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]
Output: 16
```

## 💡 Approach

### **1. Use a HashMap to Store Product Counts**
- Iterate over all unique pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` and compute their product.
- Store the product in a dictionary with its frequency.

### **2. Calculate Tuples from Product Frequency**
- If a product appears `freq` times, we can form `freqC2 = (freq * (freq - 1)) / 2` pairs.
- Since each valid `(a, b, c, d)` tuple can be arranged in `8` different ways, multiply the count by `8`.

## 🚀 Implementation
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def tupleSameProduct(nums):
    product_count = defaultdict(int)
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0

    # Store the frequency of each product
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            product = nums[i] * nums[j]
            product_count[product] += 1

    # Calculate the total number of tuples
    for freq in product_count.values():
        if freq > 1:
            count += (freq * (freq - 1)) // 2 * 8  # Formula for choosing 2 pairs and multiplying by 8

    return count
```

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis
| Step | Time Complexity |
|------|---------------|
| Generating all pairs | **O(N²)** |
| Processing the HashMap | **O(N²)** |
| **Overall Complexity** | **O(N²)** |

- **Space Complexity**: **O(N²)** (in the worst case where all products are unique)

---

## 🔥 Edge Cases Considered
- **Minimum Input**: `nums = [1,2]`
- **All Elements Prime**: `nums = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]` (no valid tuples)
- **Large Inputs**: To ensure performance holds at `N ≤ 1000`
- **Duplicate Products**: Cases where multiple pairs give the same product.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
✅ Uses a **hashmap** for efficient lookups.  
✅ **Avoids unnecessary recomputation** by precomputing product frequencies.  
✅ **Scalable for large inputs** within LeetCode constraints.
