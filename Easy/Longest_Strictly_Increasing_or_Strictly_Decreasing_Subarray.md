# Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

## Example
### Input:
```plaintext
arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 4]
```

### Output:
```plaintext
4
```

### Explanation:
The longest strictly increasing subarray is `[1, 2, 3]` (length 3) or `[5, 6, 7]` (length 3).
The longest strictly decreasing subarray is `[7, 4]` (length 2).
Thus, the maximum length is `4`.

## Approach
1. **Initialize variables:**
   - `max_length = 1` (to track the longest subarray length found so far)
   - `inc_length = 1` (for increasing sequences)
   - `dec_length = 1` (for decreasing sequences)

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - If `arr[i] > arr[i-1]`, increase `inc_length` and reset `dec_length` to `1`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, increase `dec_length` and reset `inc_length` to `1`.
   - Update `max_length` with the maximum of `inc_length`, `dec_length`, and `max_length`.

3. **Return the maximum length found.**

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as only a few variables are used.

## Code Implementation
### Python Solution
```python
def longest_strict_subarray(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    max_length = 1
    inc_length = 1
    dec_length = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            inc_length += 1
            dec_length = 1
        elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            dec_length += 1
            inc_length = 1
        else:
            inc_length = 1
            dec_length = 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, inc_length, dec_length)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 4]
print(longest_strict_subarray(arr))  # Output: 4
```

## Edge Cases Considered
- Array with all increasing numbers.
- Array with all decreasing numbers.
- Array with all elements the same.
- Empty array.
- Single-element array.

## Alternative Approaches
### Using Two-Pointer Sliding Window
Instead of maintaining lengths dynamically, we could use two pointers to track the start of increasing or decreasing subarrays and update the max length when a break occurs. However, this would still have `O(n)` time complexity but may introduce additional complexity in code structure.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently finds the longest contiguous subarray that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing using a single pass and constant space.
