A well-structured study plan is crucial for effectively preparing for coding interviews and mastering LeetCode problems. Below is a comprehensive plan to help you tackle problems efficiently, categorized by topic and difficulty.

---

## Study Plan Overview

- **Duration**: 8 weeks (adjust based on your schedule)
- **Focus Areas**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.
- **Daily Commitment**: 1-2 hours (adjust based on availability)

---

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1-2: Arrays & Strings
- **Objective**: Understand basic operations, sorting algorithms, and common problems.
- **Daily Tasks**:
  - **Day 1-3**: Solve easy-level array problems (e.g., finding duplicates, two-sum).
  - **Day 4-6**: Solve easy to medium-level string problems (e.g., anagrams, substring search).
  - **Day 7**: Review and summarize key concepts, revisit any challenging problems.

### Week 3-4: Linked Lists
- **Objective**: Master operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal in linked lists.
- **Daily Tasks**:
  - **Day 1-3**: Solve basic linked list problems (e.g., reverse a list, detect cycles).
  - **Day 4-6**: Tackle medium-level linked list problems (e.g., merge two lists, remove nth node).
  - **Day 7**: Review, practice problems with variations, and study linked list-related algorithms.

### Week 5-6: Trees & Graphs
- **Objective**: Understand tree and graph traversal techniques and related problems.
- **Daily Tasks**:
  - **Day 1-3**: Solve basic tree problems (e.g., binary tree traversal, balanced tree).
  - **Day 4-6**: Work on graph problems (e.g., shortest path, depth-first search, breadth-first search).
  - **Day 7**: Review and summarize, focus on hybrid problems that combine tree and graph concepts.

### Week 7: Dynamic Programming
- **Objective**: Learn dynamic programming techniques and solve related problems.
- **Daily Tasks**:
  - **Day 1-3**: Study and solve basic dynamic programming problems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem).
  - **Day 4-6**: Tackle medium to hard dynamic programming problems (e.g., longest common subsequence, coin change).
  - **Day 7**: Review concepts, practice complex dynamic programming problems.

### Week 8: Review and Mock Interviews
- **Objective**: Consolidate your knowledge and practice under timed conditions.
- **Daily Tasks**:
  - **Day 1-3**: Review and solve problems from each category. Focus on any weak areas.
  - **Day 4-6**: Take timed mock interviews or complete problem sets simulating real interview conditions.
  - **Day 7**: Reflect on your performance, review solutions, and make a final push on any challenging topics.

## Additional Tips

- **Consistency**: Study regularly and avoid cramming. Consistent practice leads to better retention and skill improvement.
- **Understand Concepts**: Focus on understanding underlying concepts rather than just memorizing solutions.
- **Practice with Purpose**: Identify and work on your weaknesses. Prioritize problems that challenge your current skill level.
- **Use LeetCode Discussion**: Engage with the LeetCode community to learn different approaches and solutions.

---

## Resources

- **Websites**: LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks, and educational YouTube channels.
- **Tools**: Use LeetCode's built-in code editor for practice, and consider using additional tools like IDEs for larger problems.
